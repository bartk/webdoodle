webdoodle
=========

Example usage of JavaEE 7 JAX-RS (REST API) and WebSocket Protocol based backend integrated with AngularJS based view. Enjoy!!!

Use convenience bash scripts to build and run webdoodle:
  - rebuild.sh
  - run.sh
  - debug.sh (runs with JVM debugger listening on port 9009)
  - debug_wait.sh (waits for debugger connection before launch)

Tested on Glassfish 4.0 server - since this project uses Mavan and maven-embedded-glassfish-plugin there is no need for seperate Glassfish installation.

Requirements:
=============
  - JDK 1.7 - download from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
  - Maven (3.x.x) - (required by build and run scripts) download from http://maven.apache.org/
